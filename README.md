# Browse and Search Movies with Ease: A Lightweight Preact App

**This user-friendly app lets you explore the world of movies through browsing
and powerful search, powered by `themoviedb` API.** Built with speed and
efficiency in mind, it leverages the lightweight power of Preact and
performance-boosting Million to give you a smooth and responsive experience.

## Motivation

**Performance Powerhouse:** We were excited to explore the potential of Preact
and Million, aiming for a lightning-fast app with minimal bundle size. The
results? A smooth and responsive experience that pushes the boundaries of
performance.

**API Integration Deep Dive:** This project takes you on a deep dive into
integrating the `themoviedb` API using `axios`, a popular HTTP client library,
to demonstrate best practices for leveraging powerful third-party resources
within your Preact applications.

**CI/CD Mastery:** We implemented CI/CD practices using Github actions,
demonstrating how to automate workflow and optimize your development process.

**Semantic Release Bonus:** By incorporating semantic-release, we ensure
streamlined deployments, accurate versioning, and a clear changelog based on
commit message conventions.
